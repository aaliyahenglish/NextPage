## Favorite Apps (Categorizing and Evaluating)

### Goodreads
- **Category:** Social reading/Book Tracking Platform.
- **Market:** Readers, book club, authors. 
- **Mobile:** Mobile App does exist but outdated UI.
- **Habit:** Users can log books, update reading progress, and review titles. Community engagement mainly via reviews and discussion groups. Tend to be used when readers finished a book, but not daily.
- **Evaluation:** Great for cataloging and reviewing books. But weak at social features and poor mobile experiences.

## Fable
- **Category:** Social reading/ book club app.
- **Market:** Book lovers seeking community, competes with Goodreads but more modern and community-driven. Pretty niche but is growing among avid readers and professionals.
- **Mobile:** Strong Visuals, journal-style discussions. Intergrates chat and progress tracking.
- **Habit:** User reflect on books and emotions, has notifications and challenges promote regular engagement.

## Tumblr
- **Category:** Microblogging and social networking platform, Popular among fandoms, and allow creative expression.
- **Market:** Artists, Writers, fandom communites
- **Mobile:** Easy to reblog, comment, and discover tags
- **Habit:** Encourages creativity and identity expression. Feeds are community trends.

## New App Ideas - List
1. NextPage
    * A fun, swipe-based mobile app that helps readers discover their next favorite book. Instead of endless lists, users can swipe right on stories that match their interests, moods, and reading goals.
2. LibraryPal
    * A mobile app that helps users interact with their local library in a modern, mobile-friendly way.
3. Page Your Mark
    * Designed for readers who not only track what they’re reading, but also how each book makes them feel. The idea: after or during your reading sessions, you select an emotion (or multiple) tied to that book (or chapter), log a quick note, and over time you build a “reading-emotion map” of your literary journey.

## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
### 1. NextPage
- **Description:** A fun, swipe-based mobile app that helps readers discover their next favorite book. Instead of endless lists, users can swipe right on stories that match their interests, moods, and reading goals.
- **Category:** Entertainment/Book Reading
- **Mobile:** The swipe interaction is perfect for touch devices; very visual and engaging.
- **Story:** Playful, lighthearted. It’s about finding your next great read, almost like meeting your next love story. Appeals to emotion and curiosity.
- **Market** Very Broad, similar to Goodreads or Fable, but with a more cooler vibe. Very compatiable with Younger readers who love the "romance" feel of finding a new read. 
- **Habit** Medium — users might check in a few times a week to swipe, but less daily retention unless paired with recommendations or community.
- **Scope** Moderate
    - Version 1 : User Authentication – Users can create an account or log in to save preferences and book data.
    - Home Screen (“Book Cards”) – Displays a deck of book cards showing the cover image.
    Swipe Right → Interested
    Swipe Left → Not Interested
    - Book Details View – Tapping a card opens a page showing:
        - Synopsis
        - Author name
        - External links to Goodreads, Amazon, or Barnes & Noble

    - “Currently Seeing” Page – Stores books the user swiped right on, reflecting their current reading interests in a playful “dating” app theme.


### 2. LibraryPal
- **Description** A mobile app that helps users interact with their local library in a modern, mobile-friendly way.
- **Category** Productivity/Education
- **Mobile** Practical mobile experience — ideal for on-the-go users who want to check availability, reserve books, or get reminders. Works well with notifications.
- **Story** Helpful and reliable — “your library in your pocket.” Makes the library experience less intimidating and more accessible.
- **Market** Niche but strong — targeted to students, educators, and library patrons. Could be attractive if you connect it with a real library API
- **Habit** regular users (especially students) would use it weekly for book tracking or due date reminders.
- **Scope** Maybe a little difficult, depends on API complexity. A simple MVP (search + borrowed books + reminders) is doable. Adding multi-library support or real-time availability is more advanced.

### 3. PageYourMark
- **Description** Lifestyle / Wellness / Reflective reading
- **Category** Perfect for mobile journaling — quick emotion logs, sliders, and cozy visuals. Ideal for daily or session-based interactions
- **Story** Deep and personal — blends reading and mindfulness. “Your story within the stories you read.” Very emotionally resonant and unique.
- **Market** Emerging niche — appeals to reflective readers, book journaling enthusiasts, and wellness-minded audiences. Few direct competitors, so strong originality.
- **Habit** High — encourages users to log emotions after every reading session. Builds long-term emotional data. Great potential for retention.
- **Scope** emotion logging, charts and analysis, and API for book info
